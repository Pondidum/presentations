# Speaker notes

* normally I talk about technical topics; Architecture, design patterns, domain design etc.
* so when Arado asked me if I would like to speak here again, and what would I like to talk about, I said I have lightning talks on feature toggling, automation or eventsoucing
* a little later the response came back: "how do you feel about talking about your experiences streaming?"
* so naturally I said sure, why not.
* So here is my talk on streaming dotnet Development
* I started streaming x weeks ago on twitch
* I decided to stream the entire development process of building a project
* namely, a restful, eventsourced feature toggling service, which I have called Crispin
* so far, the experience has been pretty fun
* helps me focus (You can't just wander off and stare into space while streaming...)
* but lets take a step back.  why did I decide to do this?
* normally the steps are:
  1. start streaming
  2. ...
  3. profit
* but in my case I read an article posted to reddit about xxxxx streaming nodejs hardware dev, and thought that it sounded fun
* So I gave it a go
  1. start streaming (tick)
  2. ...
  3. ...
* I don't have any steps, I don't really know what I am doing, but I *am* enjoying myself.
* so how did it go?
* well I had 5 viewers in my first stream!
* I get a 1 or 2 more each time I stream
* twitch chat is usually pretty quiet
* but living in Finland, I am used to "pretty quiet"
* and to be honest I am a chatterbox all the time, so me talking and everyone else being quiet is the norm...
