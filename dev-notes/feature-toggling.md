# Abstracts

Feature toggles are a great asset to your development workflow - they make experimentation and incremental changes easier, and help push features through faster.  But there is a downside - old flags, unused flags, or worse, re-used flags.

This talk will cover how to use feature toggles effectively, cover some of the horror stories, how the horrors can be avoided, and how to deal with them if they do occur.  Examples in C#, but applicable everywhere.

Branching is a great feature in version control, but is it slowing you down, and causing headaches you could avoid?  Another approach is to use feature toggles rather than branches where you can.  Feature Toggles can speed up development, enable experimenting, and reduce merge hell, but there is a certain amount of apprehension to their use.

This talk will cover how to use feature toggles effectively, how to avoid the downsides to them, and how you can migrate a branching strategy to a toggling strategy.  Examples in C#, but applicable everywhere.

Feature toggles are a great asset to your development workflow - they make experimentation and incremental changes easier, and help push features through faster. But there are potential problems: old flags, unused flags, or worse, re-used flags can come and bite you when you are least expecting it.
