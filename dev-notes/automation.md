# Abstracts

When we think of automation, we tend to think of build and deployment scripts, but there is so much more that can be automated; we can automate infrastructure, development environments, workflows and processes and regular tasks.  We can save a lot of time, and remove mental workloads by having scripts do things for us.

Come to this talk to see all the automation we have embedded in our organisation so far, and what we are going to be trying out in the future.


* naming pull requests
* pull request to the correct branch
* links to documentation
* checks for docs, tests, logging dashboard, etc.
* auto update tickets with resolutions
  * e.g. "fixes pay-123"
* auto create a branch (for features starting)
* prevent merging to master until deployment
* auto merge to master after x hours of deployment
